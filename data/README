Please read the documentation in doc/README_VitisOmics.org.

This directory should contain data from external sources, such as NCBI, EBI,
URGI, CRIBI, etc.

Such files are downloaded via bash scripts in src/.

As these files are available somewhere else, are large and often compressed,
they should not be versionned!
